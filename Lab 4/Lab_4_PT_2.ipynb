Whereas most model datasets are provided in GRIB format, most other atmospheric datasets are provided in netCDF format. One advantage of netCDF is that it is what is known as self-describing, meaning that everything you need (or that Python needs) to interpret the data is provided in the file - you don't need to look up something from elsewhere!\n",
